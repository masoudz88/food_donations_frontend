# food_donations_frontend
## waste management System
* In this project I am using **React** to develop a website that companies can manage their waste to help to charity organizations
* The admin can log in if it has an account, then there is a list of companies that can be added or removed by the __admin__.
* I have used context to manage the list of companies and how to add and remove companies
* All the data are stored in backend database
